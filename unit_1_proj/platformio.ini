; ESP32-S3 quirk:
; When PlatformIO opens Serial Monitor it toggles DTR/RTS control lines.
; On this board those lines are wired to EN (reset) and GPIO0 (boot mode).
; That can accidentally reboot the chip into the bootloader (DOWNLOAD mode),
; stopping the running firmware.
; Disable them so opening the monitor does not reset the board.
